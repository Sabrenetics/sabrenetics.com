          <h2>Piercing metal quality and testing</h2>
          <p>
            What piercing metal is best to use: The best piercing material depends on the type of piercing and individual preferences. However, generally, high-quality surgical-grade stainless steel, titanium, niobium, and solid 14k or 18k gold are good options for piercing jewellery as they are hypoallergenic and less likely to cause an allergic reaction or infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential to choose jewelry that is made from non-porous and non-toxic materials that are safe for prolonged contact with the body. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the jewelry is properly sterilized before being inserted into a new piercing to minimize the risk of infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's always best to consult with a professional piercer or reputable piercing studio for advice on the best piercing material for your specific situation.

          <h2>How to discover the metal type of a piercing</h2>
          <p>
            Piercings are a popular way to adorn the body, and they come in various materials. However, not all materials are created equal, and it's essential to know how to tell the material of a piercing to ensure that you select the right one for your body and style.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Ask Your Piercer:</strong> The easiest way to determine the material of a piercing is to ask the piercer who made it. Professional piercers use high-quality materials that are safe for most people, and they should be able to tell you what kind of material your piercing is made of. If you're unsure of the material of your piercing, or you want to get a new one, it's best to visit a reputable piercing studio and talk to a professional piercer.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for Markings:</strong> Most piercings are marked with symbols or letters that indicate the material they are made of. For example, surgical steel piercings are often marked with "316L" or "316LVM," which stands for the grade of steel used. Titanium piercings may be marked with "Ti" or "ASTM F136," which is the medical-grade standard for titanium used in body jewellery. Gold piercings may be marked with "14K" or "18K," which indicates the purity of the gold. If you can't see any markings on your piercing, you can use a magnifying glass to get a closer look. If you still can't find any markings, it may be difficult to determine the material of your piercing without professional help.</li>
            <li><strong>Test for Magnetism:</strong> Another way to identify the material of a piercing is to test its magnetism. Some metals are magnetic, while others are not. To test the magnetism of your piercing, you can use a magnet or a magnetic field detector. If the magnet sticks to your piercing, it's likely made of a magnetic metal like stainless steel or nickel. If the magnet does not stick, your piercing may be made of a non-magnetic metal like titanium or gold. It's important to note that some piercings may be made of a combination of metals, so the magnet test may not always provide a definitive answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Acid Test:</strong> Another way to test what metal a piercing is made of is to use an acid test. This test involves applying a small amount of acid to the piercing and observing the reaction. To perform an acid test, first, put on protective gloves and goggles to avoid contact with the acid. Then, apply a drop of acid to the piercing and observe the reaction. Different metals will react differently to the acid, which can help identify what the piercing is made of.</li>
            <li><strong>X-Ray Fluorescence Test:</strong> Another way to test what metal a piercing is made of is to use an X-ray fluorescence test. This test involves using an X-ray machine to analyse the composition of the metal. To perform an X-ray fluorescence test, you'll need to visit a professional who has access to an X-ray machine. The machine will emit a low level of radiation that will penetrate the metal and provide information about its composition.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Discoloration or Tarnishing:</strong> Certain metals can tarnish or discolour over time, especially if they come into contact with sweat, water, or other substances. For example, silver and copper piercings may tarnish, while stainless steel piercings may discolour or rust. If you notice any discoloration or tarnishing on your piercing, it may be an indication of the material it's made of.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider the Price:</strong> The price of a piercing can also be an indicator of the material it's made of. In general, high-quality materials like titanium, gold, and platinum are more expensive than lower-quality materials like stainless steel and plastic.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider Your Skin Sensitivity:</strong> Lastly, it's essential to consider your skin sensitivity when selecting the material of your piercing. Some people are allergic to certain metals, which can cause discomfort, irritation, or even infection. Common metal allergies include nickel, copper, and brass.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            How to sterilise equipment: Sterilizing piercing equipment is essential to ensure that it is safe to use on clients and to prevent the spread of infections. Here are the steps for sterilizing piercing equipment:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Disinfection:</strong> Before sterilizing your equipment, it is important to first clean it thoroughly. Start by wiping down all surfaces with a disinfectant solution, such as 70% isopropyl alcohol. This will help to remove any dirt, debris, or microorganisms that may be present on the surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Autoclaving:</strong> The most effective way to sterilize piercing equipment is through autoclaving. An autoclave is a machine that uses high heat and pressure to kill all microorganisms on the equipment. To autoclave your equipment, follow these steps:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Place your equipment in an autoclave-safe container, such as a sterilization pouch or wrapped in autoclave paper.</li>
                <li>Place the container in the autoclave, following the manufacturer's instructions for loading and operation.</li>
                <li>Set the autoclave to the appropriate settings, such as 121°C and 15 PSI for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Start the autoclave cycle and wait for it to finish.</li>
                <li>Once the cycle is complete, allow the equipment to cool down before removing it from the autoclave.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dry Heat Sterilization:</strong> Another method of sterilizing piercing equipment is dry heat sterilization. This method involves heating the equipment to a high temperature for an extended period of time to kill all microorganisms. To sterilize your equipment using dry heat, follow these steps:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Place your equipment in an oven-safe container, such as a sterilization pouch or wrapped in aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the appropriate temperature, such as 160°C for 120 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place the container in the oven and close the door.</li>
                <li>Allow the equipment to heat for the appropriate amount of time.</li>
                <li>Once the time is up, turn off the oven and allow the equipment to cool down before removing it from the oven.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Sterilization:</strong> Another option for sterilizing piercing equipment is chemical sterilization. This involves soaking the equipment in a chemical solution that kills all microorganisms. To sterilize your equipment using chemical sterilization, follow these steps:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Place your equipment in a sterilization tray or container.</li>
                <li>Add a sterilizing solution, such as glutaraldehyde or hydrogen peroxide, to the tray or container.</li>
                <li>Make sure the equipment is fully submerged in the solution.</li>
                <li>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the appropriate soaking time, typically around 10-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the soaking time is up, remove the equipment from the solution and rinse thoroughly with sterile water.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            It is important to follow proper sterilization procedures and to use equipment that is specifically designed for sterilization. Additionally, it is important to monitor the sterilization process and to regularly test the equipment to ensure that it is effective at killing all microorganisms.
