          <h2>A</h2>
          <p><b>Abstraction</b> - A principal concept to computer science related to the modeling, theory, and design of programming language to give meaningful names to code functionality. Abstracting something means to give definition to things, so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does.</p>
          <p><b>Active filter</b> - Electronic filters are a type of signal processing filter in the form of electrical circuits. That is, using components and interconnections that, in analysis, can be considered to exist at a single point. These components can be in discrete packages or part of an integrated circuit.</p>
          <p><b>AJAX</b> - AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. Isn't a programming language, AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.</p>
          <p><b>Aliasing</b> - A high frequency signal appearing low frequency after sampling at a low sampling is called aliasing.</p>
          <p><b>Amplifier</b> - An amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). It is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output.</p>
          <p><b>API</b> - Abbreviation; Application Programming Interface. The set of subroutines definition, tools and communication protocols for software development. The subroutines provide an communication between the components in an software that may be accessed externally to interface with the software. e.g. Facebook provides an API to embed Facebook JavaScript into an HTML webpage to allow Facebook commenting on a web page.</p>
          <p><b>Artificial neural networks (ANN)</b> - Also known as connectionist systems are computing systems that are similar to biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without programmed with task-specific rules. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analysing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results to identify cats in other images. They do this without any prior knowledge of cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the examples that they process.</p>
          <p>An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it.</p>
          <p>In ANN implementations, the "signal" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.</p>

          <p><b>Backus-Naur form [Backus normal form BNF]</b> - Is a notation technique for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages.</p>
          <p>A BNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as "&lt;symbol&gt; ::= &lt;expression&gt;" where &lt;symbol&gt; is a nonterminal, and the &lt;expression&gt; consists of one or more sequences of symbols; more sequences are separated by the vertical bar "|", indicating a choice, the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left. Symbols that never appear on a left side are terminals. On the other hand, symbols that appear on a left side are non-terminals and are always enclosed between the pair &lt;&gt;. The "::=" means that the &lt;symbol&gt; on the left must be replaced with the expression on the right.</p>
          <p>In PowerShell the BNF specification is used to define rules of creating and defining PowerShell commands through using a Verb, dash (-) Noun grammar standardization. Not all commands use BNF but the specialization was implemented for future proofing, third party and vendor module development.</p>

The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646, and both are code-for-code identical.</p>
          <p>Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The Unicode standard defines UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, and several other encodings are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and UCS-2, a precursor of UTF-16.</p>
          <p><b>UTF-8</b> - a variable width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid code points in Unicode using one to four 8-bit bytes. The encoding is defined by the Unicode standard, and was originally designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. The name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format – 8-bit. t was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII.</p>
          <p>UTF-8 has been the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web since 2009, as it is most popular in every country, and as of July 2018 accounts for 91.8% of all web pages.</p>
